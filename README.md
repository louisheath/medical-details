## medical-details

This repo holds the web-app aspect of our team's project for the Bristol Electrical and Electronic Engineering Society's (BEEES) 2018 Makeathon.

Someone who is particularly prone to injury or who is taking crucial medication can choose to wear an RFID wristband, which when scanned produces their profile on this web-app. Their profile provides information crucial to their treatment, if for example the wearer is unconcious.

The web-app is written in Java using Spring MVC. It is set up to be hosted on Heroku along with its postgreSQL database.

My team mates focused on a motion detection system which recognises when a person falls to the floor. The desired application for this system is for installation in the home of an elderly person, who may easily get injured from a fall in their home.
